    <p>I went tto Singapore for probably 2 times. On my second day, I'll always go to universal studios first. Enjoy rides and attractions like Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers Ride, Cylon, and "far far away" and enjoying the foods. It will be a must to buy their signature headbands and buying cute merchandise. Since I went to Signapore with my mom because my dad was staying in Indonesia for work, I enjoyed a girls date in many places in Singapore. My dad joined when we went to Sentosa Island. It was really fun and I can't believe I rode the zipline that carries me from a forest to Sentosa beach. My favorite part of the ride is visiting Gardens by the Bay, you could see and learn all types of flowers and plants, you could walk through bridges, and I love it!
